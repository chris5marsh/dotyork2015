# Bringing consumer-level design to enterprise-level development
###Michael Gould, Anaplan

Anaplan is SaaS, all online - users and consumers

Enterprise UI/UX design is often overlooked, but is a vital part of a business plan.

e.g. HP's sale quotas - -deciding which customers to target and how much to sell.

Used to be done using spreadsheets... Difficult balance between speed and sharing the workload/reward.

e.g. Diageo's promotions planning

Solving complex problems, but keeping deisgn and UX at the core.

People compare with desktop applications e.g. Excel. Local data is quicker to access and more intereactive. Users expect the same experience on a web app.

Data volumes can be enormous - how can this operate at scale?

Complex relationships between reps, products, change over time.

* Prioritise UX/UI design
* Talk to users, not just clients
* Innovate - new tech?
