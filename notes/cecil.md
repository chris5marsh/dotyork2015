#What shouold the UNESCO designation mean for York?
###Charles Cecil

York needs to take advantage of its designation.

Revolution Games (Broken Sword etc.) publishes games across all platforms.

Lots of games around the mid-90s were from UK studios - continued to this day.

With the arrival of the PS, games started costing lots more. Almost impossible to survive as an indie developer.

But then in 2007 meant that the developer could go straight to the consumer through the App Store.

Something like 12 days of Christmas blew app downloads out of the water. Plus it also boosted sales afterwards.

Broken Sword 5 was self-funded, then went to Kickstarter.

Different places monetise in different ways.

## Why York?

York is a beautiful, historical city. Always been a crossroads.

UNESCO designation offers an opportunity.

Within Yorkshire: rebalancing economy North/South; Bradford for film and ``Hull as city of culture.

* Screen Yorkshire has helped push Yokshire as a place for film and TV.
* York can be the cultural hub.
* Redevelopment of the Guildhall.
* University facilities.
* Extraordinary community of developers in York and Yorkshire

## Some thoughts

* Crossroads of media: film, TV, web, games...
* Intermingling of formats
* We can teach each other across disciplines
