# Style Guides, Pattern Llibraries and Code Guides
### Anna Debenham

## Types of styleguides

* Brand guidelines
* Print guidelines
* Content/Editorial guidelines
* Coding standards
* Website styleguides - often a mixture of all the above

Not one way of doing a styleguide.

### Interface audit

Go through everything on the site and compartmentalise them.

### Style tiles

Halfway between moddboard and mockup. Tool for conversation rather than a starting point.

Some design snippets, pick out words you might use.

## Element collages

Mockup of design elements on a page, rather than full comps.

At clearleft, they used wide horizontal pages to avoid being mistaken for pages

## Style prototypes

Building straight in to code. While site planning is still in the works.

## Pattern primer

Ongoing documentation. A system of components. THey use the same markup and styles as the live site.

## CSS Guidelines

Advice and guidelines for writng code

## What they achieve

* Make up for the work that they cost.
* Keeps you on track - design, dev and live don't differ. Starbuck's guide.
* Excellent for if external developers work on it.
* Encourages consistency and better coding practice

Rapid iteration can cause inconsistency, so keeping the styleguide up to date is important for keeping track.

You don't have to get approval every step of the way, they are just part of the living styleguide.

Salesforce add their markup to a phone-shaped iframe on the site.

THink of the site as a system, not a series of pages.

Have one person as a champion for the styleguide.

Can test performance on each pattern.Lonely Planet outputs stats for the components: size, load, selector numbers.

Makes it easy to do rapid prototypes.

Doesn't it lead to boring design? No, as it gives you the time and space to add the design details that you reallyneed.

## How to make one

* How strict should it be?
* Show pattern name
* Show full-width component
* Show code

Components should fill thir container. Add in swatches, typography. There are third party applications to build them (Pattern Lab etc).

Styleguide must be available from outside your internal network.

## Gotchas

* They don't replace conversations
* Build from the very start, not as an afterthought
* It doesn't have to be pretty
* Make it neat and tidy - new patterns cost and obsolete patterns confuse
* Trying to deliver everything even if it won't be used!

## Next steps

* Can always be improved
* Add in time to improve them
* An out-of-date style gide is worse than no style guide at all
* Power them via live code? (cf Lonely Planet)
* Make it public
  * Keeps you honest
  * Recruitment tool
