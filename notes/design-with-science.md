Being micromanaged, losing the magic from design,getting criticism from internal team are all problems faced in design and dev.

Design can be a power struggle.

## Talk stories

Science and data can help with proving your decisions.

e.g. rail ticketing system

Reducing queues and making it easy to get the tickets. Putting collectonn code in subject line reduced waiting time.

e.g. asterisks on required fields

Not everyone understands them. Instead, marking optional fields.

## Talk business

When Google talked to Viacom, and told them they can prove the effect of advertising, they were told they were screwing with magic.

Google and MIcrosoft cannot predict the effect of advertising (cf academic paper)

Understanding how business works is important. 5 basic business models.

## Talk data

It is bewildering how much is being measured - Google Analytics, Alexa etc.

We need to sift the right data. Just measure 2 or 3 things, and for each make sure there's a timescale, a benchmark, a reason to be reported and an associated action. The last one often doesn't get done!

Data shows confidence in the design.

## Talk objectively

Using "I" can make things personal. You're advocating things based on your opinion. It opens up someone in the room to have an opposing view. Usually not based on data.

**DON'T PRESENT ANY WORK USING "I", "THINK" OR "FEEL"**

Don't confuse design with art. Design has a reason and an effect.

## Talk theory

Subliminal advertising in the cinema reported a 58% increase in popcorn consumption. But he made the whole thing up! Built his career on a made-up theory.

But modern advertisers wtill use it!

Spot the good and bad science. There are good theories and you can use them to support your design.
