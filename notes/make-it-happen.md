##Working on challenging projects

Music video for Tweedy. Sweat and strategy.

New to 3D, no experience in cinematography. e.g. movement all in one direction, no experience in framing... and just three weeks!

Learning process is deeply embedded. Learning and educating combined = self-teaching

Seeking out a talented team to surround yourself with.

When things start getiing stale and you lose interest, move on. What's next?

The volume and density of work is a pointer to growth. Productivity is like a pulse.

## Moving fast and producing a lot

### Moving fast

Speed helps you get momentum. Ideas can flourish when you give yourself context.

* Go wide
* Prioritise
* Go deep

List out everything; emphasise the important; dive in to those.

> Done is better than perfect.

### Producing a lot

Consistent practice that will lead you to produce a lot.

Solving the problems of emotional threat and ego depletion (running out of mental capacity at the end of the day).

#### Second shift

What you do on the side, in addition to your day job.

* Chained - add to something else
* Achievable - you can do it
* Pay off - you get something at the end

There are certain things you do every day. Instead of scheduling something new, attach it to something else that you always do.

If it's achievable you don't dread it. Set yourself small goals.

Find purpose and clarity in what you're doing.

* Work hard
* Work smart

> Our actions are our only true belongings
