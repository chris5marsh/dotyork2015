#Wanting the Web to #Win

###Phil Hawkesworth

##Brief history of the web.

All started with the hypertext link. LInking to anything from anywhere. You create a relationship between two resources.

Anatomy of link is the same as that of a URL.

Giving relationships using `rel`: this is `me`, this should be `prefetch`ed.

Cursor, hover state became an affordance that showed we can move between pages.

Tech/UX isn't in a battle with design.

Trends (e.g. parallax) aren't necessarily bad, but implementation can be.

Cookie cutter sites...

Material design has been replicated all over the place, not always well.

They want to achieve a unified experience across platforms and devices. Establishing a design language.

## Standards & Conentions vs. Trends

Flash design trends went through the same thing. Not the fault of a single designer, just a trend that passes.

It's really important to be good at this stuff now.

Latest trends (full page bleeds, video etc) can make pages break on slow connections. Performance is part of the design

Know your audience. Empathy is the foundation of creating better work.

People are now showing their work in styleguides and sharing their work and their processes.

styleguides.io

Deliverables like styleguides make more sense. Deliver things quickly and iteratively.

Native apps and web apps should be able to live side by side. e.g. Taco Bell - only in an app

But native apps don't scale. Web apps can do most of what native apps can do.

## Progressive Enhancement

HTML is very robust, JS less so.

Be conservative in what you do, liberal in what you expect.

Know that you don't know what the user might have.

What device, what input, what bandwidth, what tech...

Even just viewport sizes changes incredibly between sites.

We don't have complete control.

## WHy should the web win

If access to the web increases, social dev and political representation will rise.

The web isn't evenly distributed.
