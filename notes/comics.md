# Learning from Comics
### Bonny Colville-Hyde

How do we make good digital stuff? Not just good intentions.

Have to understand requirements and get buy-in from stakeholders.

User research can be shocking when you get involved. But you get to see the responses directly. It's hard to document it though. Not engaging decision-makers is a failure.

Social styles - how we communicate with team members. You must tailor what you're doing for the audience.

Try and identify what you do for eac type: Relator, Socializer, Thinker, Director

Communication is hard - we often go on feelings, not facts.

Explaining something isn't the same as experienciing it. Engage people with experiences and stories. People love stories.

Comics have been used for 1000s of years: hieroglyphics; safety cards, art.

Words and pictures communicate great messages.

## Why are comics successful?

About 2/3 of communication is non-verbal, and much of it is interpreted. We can read body language of stickmen.

We're drowning in boring documentation. Comics break down that dullness. They're novel, they're empathetic and they explain.

People start talking about people and users, instead of features and functions.

Can be used in:

### Pitching

Find simple user requirements to create a story. Classic story arc: show normality, then catatrophic event, then resolution, then back t a new normality.

### Share research

e.g. car financing

OFten a couple, one would be more knowledgable, one more skeptical.

Comic shows a couple test-driving and deciding, and taking time out to discuss with each other.

### New ideas for users

Would this new feature work? How would it best be implemented?

### Develop Personas

Figure out who your audience is and create personas for them (cf Mailchimp)

### Communicate and explore ideas

e.g. comic for Chrome

## What makes a comic?

* Single panel/multi panel.
* Gutters showing division in time/space.
* Speech/thought/machine speech

### But I can't draw!

* Make it simple, it just stakes practice
* Eyebrows and mouth change to communicate emotion.
* Build up people
* Make characters - if you have more than one they will need differentiation
* Make libraries in e.g. Illustrator

## Remember

* Engage decision makers
* Don't obsess about process
* Speak to users
* PLAN!
* Make it easy for yourself
* Have fun
