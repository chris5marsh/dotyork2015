#One Interface to Rule Them All
##Josh Emerson

Landscape of the web has shifted. 800px went to 1024 went to 1200... then mobile devices came out... then tablets... now watches? TVs?

Watch is tiny screen really close; TV is massive screen far away.

Input types are different as well - keyboard, mouse, touch, mic, gamepad...

## Uniting the interface

Android is moving in to theses spaces. Material design is their attempt to cover all these interfaces.

Apple adapts their interface to the input type - bigger/smaller hit areas.

**AFFORDANCES PROVIDE STRONG CLUES TO THE OPERATION OF THINGS**

Without them, people don't know exactly how to use something.

Windows 10 adapts to the user input - keyboard attached becomes desktop interface, without it becomes touch interface.

Plus Cortana (Siri for Windows)

## A different kind of browser

You can integrate your app with Cortana (e.g. search Wikipedia)

The way the web works allows for e.g. screenreaders, to navigate with their voice. In Spartan, Cortana is integrated, allowing a richness of data. Currently not quite integrated in the same way.

## Beyond the screen

e.g. Google Glass Immature tech

Virtualised screens that hover? We are the screen generation. But why do we need a screen-like interface. Good solution for the time.

There will always be screens, but other ways will be discovered.

## Why does the web exist?

Memes carry cultural ideas. They can be transmitted in any number of ways.

Evolutionary impact - our networks have now grown incredibly.

The human brain has evolved so that we can understand and transmit memes as well as simply surviving.

## Interfacing with the web

Access through eyes, ears, voice, thought?

Lynx browser can still access websites and get the essential info.

e.g. the deivce designs the select button. It knows the best way to interpret a choices box to the user.

Separation of concerns - content is separate from presentation.

We can't know what it will bring, but we can adhere to standards and devices can decide the best way to present it. Semantics allows us to digest information properly.
